# Immutable values

Pure version of `replan`

```java
static List<String> replan(List<String> plan,
                           String newCity,
                           String beforeCity) {
  int newCityIndex = plan.indexOf(beforeCity);
  List<String> replanned = new ArrayList<>(plan);
  replanned.add(newCityIndex, newCity);
  return replanned;
}
```

Pure functions don’t mutate any existing values. They can’t modify anything from the argument list or the global scope. **However, they can mutate locally created values.**

```
System.out.println("Plan A: " + planA);
console output: Plan A: [Paris, Berlin, Kraków]
List<String> planB = replan(planA, "Vienna", "Kraków");
System.out.println("Plan B: " + planB);
console output: Plan B: [Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Kraków]
System.out.println("Plan A: " + planA);
console output: Plan A: [Paris, Berlin, Kraków]
```

## Coffee break: Getting burned by mutability
```java
static double totalTime(List<Double> lapTimes) {
  lapTimes.remove(0);
  double sum = 0;
  for (double x : lapTimes) {
    sum += x;
  }
  return sum;
}

static double avgTime(List<Double> lapTimes) {
  double time = totalTime(lapTimes);
  int laps = lapTimes.size();
  return time / laps;
}
```

Your task is to figure out what the correct result should be and fix
totalTime and/or avgTime accordingly.

It should print
```
Total: 63.3s
Avg: 21.1s
```

The problem is that `totalTime` removes from the global `lapTimes` list and `avgTime` calls `totalTime`, so by calling `totalTime` and `avgTime` separately, the `lapTimes` list has its first entry removes twice.

Solution:
```java
static double totalTime(List<Double> lapTimes) {
  List<Double> laps = new ArrayList<>(lapTimes);
  laps.remove(0);
  double sum = 0;
  for (double x : laps) {
    sum += x;
  }
  return sum;
}

static double avgTime(List<Double> lapTimes) {
  double time = totalTime(lapTimes);
  int laps = lapTimes.size() - 1;
  return time / laps;
}
```

If we can call a function multiple times with the same set of arguments and we always get the same result back, we say that this function is referentially transparent.

## Introducing shared mutable state

### What is shared mutable state?

A *state* is an instance of a value that is stored in one place and can be accessed from the code. If this value can be modified, we have a *mutable* state. Furthermore, if this mutable state can be accessed from different parts of the code, it’s a *shared mutable state*.

## State’s impact on programming abilities

The more things we need to keep track of, the higher the cognitive load of a task is.

## Dealing with the moving parts

**Encapsulation** is a technique that isolates a mutable state, usually inside an object. This object guards the state by making it private and making sure that all mutations are done only through this object’s interface. Then, the code responsible for manipulating the state is kept in one place. All the moving parts are hidden.

## Dealing with the moving parts using FP

**Immutable values**: A technique that guarantees that once a value is created, it can never be changed. If a programmer needs to change even the slightest portion of a value (e.g., add a string to a list), a new value needs to be created and the old one left intact.

## Coffee break: The immutable String API

Solution:

```scala
def abbreviate(s: String): String = {
  val abbreviator = "."
  s.length match {
    case 0 => ""
    case 1 => s + abbreviator
    case _ => {
      val parts = s.split(" ").toList
      val first = parts.head.slice(0, 1) + abbreviator
      (first :: parts.tail).mkString(" ")
    }
  }
}
```

Book solution:

```scala
def abbreviate(name: String): String = {
  val initial = name.substring(0, 1)
  val separator = name.indexOf(' ')
  val lastName = name.substring(separator + 1)
  initial + ". " + lastName
}
```

Doesn't handle single names or empty string though.

## Hold on ... Isn’t this bad?

Q: Isn’t copying bad in terms of performance?
A: Yes, it’s worse than just modifying things in place. Usually it's not the bottleneck and in most cases it's outweighed by the benefit of readability and maintainability.

Q: So, if I’m using functional programming, my applications will be slow?
A: Not necessarily. Find the bottleneck first, then optimize.

Q: Why can’t I just use Java’s `Collections.unmodifiableList`?
A: There is still an `add` method but it throws an exception. Weird.

## Purely functional approach to shared mutable state

```scala
def replan(plan: List[String],
           newCity: String,
           beforeCity: String): List[String] = {
  val beforeCityIndex = plan.indexOf(beforeCity)
  val citiesBefore = plan.slice(0, beforeCityIndex)
  val citiesAfter = plan.slice(beforeCityIndex, plan.size)
  citiesBefore.appended(newCity).appendedAll(citiesAfter)
}
```

## Practicing immutable slicing and appending

```scala
def firstTwo[A](l: List[A]): List[A] = l.slice(0, 2)
def lastTwo[A](l: List[A]): List[A] =  l.slice(l.size - 2, l.size)
def movedFirstTwoToTheEnd[A](l: List[A]): List[A] =
  l.slice(2, l.size).appendedAll(firstTwo(l))
def insertedBeforeLast[A](l: List[A], i: A): List[A] =
  l.slice(0, l.size - 1).appended(i).appendedAll(l.slice(l.size - 1, l.size))
```

## Summary

### Mutability is dangerous

### Fighting mutability by using copies

### What is shared mutable state?

A variable that is shared between different entities in the codebase and can be mutated by them

### Fighting mutability by using immutable values

### Using immutable APIs of `String` and `List`

### Functional programming is programming using *pure functions* that manipulate *immutable values*.
