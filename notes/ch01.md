# Learning functional programming

## Meet the function

Signature: the function name, arguments with types and return type.
Body: The code to execute the function.

> "If the signature alone is enough to understand what’s going on inside the box, it is a big win for the programmers who read the code"

### Quick exercise

`public static int increment(int x)`: int x -> increment > int

## Imperative vs. declarative

> Imperative programming focuses on how the result should be computed. It is all about defining specific steps in a specific order.

> The declarative approach focuses on what needs to be done—not how. In this case we are saying we need a length of this string, and we return this length as the score for this particular word.

## Coffee break: Imperative vs. declarative

```java
public static int calculateScore(String word) {
  int score = 0;
  for(char c : word.toCharArray()) {
    score++;
  }
  return score;
}

public static int wordScore(String word) {
  return word.length();
}
```

Change the functions above so that the following are true:
```java
calculateScore("imperative") == 9
calculateScore("no") == 2
wordScore("declarative") == 9
wordScore("yes") == 3
```

Answer:
```java
public static int calculateScore(String word) {
  int score = 0;
  for(char c : word.toCharArray()) {
    if (c != 'a') {
      score++;
    }
  }
  return score;
}

public static int wordScore(String word) {
  return word.filter(c => c != 'a').length();
}
```

## How useful is learning functional programming?

- It’s a style of writing code in any language
- Functional concepts are the same in FP languages
- Functional and declarative thinking is a powerful tool

## Leaping into Scala

Scala has all the functional programming features, while its syntax is still similar to one of the mainstream imperative languages.

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
In Scala

```scala
def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
  a + b;
}
```

## Practicing functions in Scala

Rewrite Java to Scala
```java
public static int increment(int x) {
  return x + 1;
}
public static char getFirstCharacter(String s) {
  return s.charAt(0);
}
public static int wordScore(String word)
  return word.length();
}
```

```scala
def increment(x: Int): Int = x + 1
def getFirstCharacter(s: String): Char = s.charAt(0)
def wordScore(word: String): Int = word.length
```
